# Skillab Tracker

<img src="media/logo.png">

---

A **configurable** and **extensible** tracker that **fetches**, **preprocesses**, **stores** and **serves** data from different sources for skill related entities such as Courses, Job Listings, Employee Profiles, Organizational Profiles and more.

This is a stripped-down version designed specifically for testing. It includes only a database dump of records from open sources, with many modules—such as data miners, skill and occupation extraction, translations, and others—omitted to reduce the Docker build size and simplify installation.

## How to install for testing

Prerequisites:

1. Python (most likely any 3.x.x version will do) with the venv module installed
2. Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/skillab-project/skillab-tracker-testathon.git

# Create enviroment file
cp .env.example.dev .env

# Create python virtual enviroment and install requirements
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run postgresql and load dump using Docker
docker compose up -d

# Run tests (it doesn't need the server running)
python manage.py test

# Run the server in development mode
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit the [Swagger Documentation page](http://localhost:8000/api/docs) to view the available endpoints when the server is running.
